Data Structures
==============

I implemented the following data structures in JavaScript:

- Queue
- Stack
- Set
- Linked List
- Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Graph
- Hash Table

### Testing

Tests are located in the two /spec directories. To run them, open the spec runner file in any browser.

```
SpecRunner.html
```
